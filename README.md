# Deploy a TF 2.3 Model as ONNX

In this repository there is the code of my tests on how to best deploy a TF 2.3 Model using ONNX

## Features:
* using Breast Cancer dataset for the example
* Keras/ TF 2.3 Model
* using TF Feature Column API and DenseFeatures layer for transformation
* using keras2onnx
* using ONNX as model serialization format
